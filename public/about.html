<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a motivated and detail-oriented learner with a strong interest in computer science, system software, and emerging technologies. I have experience studying core technical subjects such as system programming, compilers, microprocessors, and data structures, and I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into clear, well-structured explanations. Alongside my technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning, problem-solving, and academic excellence. I value discipline, curiosity, and clarity in my work, and I strive to apply both theoretical knowledge and practical understanding to achieve meaningful outcomes.</p>
